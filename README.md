# Stock Price Analysis Using Plotly

This project explores the usage of **Plotly** for data visualization by analyzing five stocks from the NSE website: **SBI**, **HDFC**, **ICICI**, **AXIS**, and **KOTAK**.

**Data Cleaning**
	The raw stock data was processed using pandas to handle missing values, filter irrelevant data, and prepare the dataset for analysis.

**Data Visualization**
	To gain insights into the data, I used **Plotly** to create dynamic visualizations

**Insight 1**: Animated Bar Plot
	This animation demonstrates how the closing prices of the selected stocks have changed over the years, offering a comparative perspective on their performance.

**Technologies Used**

**Python**: Core programming language.

**Pandas**: For data preprocessing and cleaning.

**Plotly**: For creating interactive and animated visualizations.

**Future Scope**

1) Adding additional stocks for comparison.
2) Implementing other types of visualizations like scatter plots and heatmaps for deeper insights.
